# React / TypeScript, TailwindCSS and d3.js boilerplate

This is a quick-start for any project involving React / TypeScript and d3.js.

The visualisation component is already set up to auto-scale on window resize, using the useRef() and useEffect() hooks.

The Visualisation.tsx file is where the d3 component can be built on top of the existing SVG element.

TailwindCSS is also ready to go for consistent styling and easy to follow styling out of the box.
